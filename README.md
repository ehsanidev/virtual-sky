# Virtual Observatory - README

Welcome to the **Virtual Observatory** project, a simple yet immersive simulation of a night sky using Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating and rendering 3D graphics in a browser. This project provides an interactive experience where users can explore a simulated star field, with added interactive elements like surprise messages when clicking on the screen.

## Project Overview

This project creates a basic 3D environment mimicking an observatory's view of the night sky. Key features include:

- **Star Field**: A vast field of stars randomly positioned to simulate the night sky.
- **Interactive Elements**: Clicking anywhere on the screen triggers a surprise message.
- **Dynamic Movement**: The star field rotates slowly to create a sense of movement in space.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled. Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd virtual-observatory
   ```

2. **Open the HTML File**: Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your web browser.

   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

   or simply double-click `index.html` if your file explorer supports this.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that loads the JavaScript.
- **js/script.js**: Contains all the Three.js logic for setting up the scene, camera, renderer, and animations.
- **css/style.css**: Basic styling for the HTML to ensure full-screen display and text styling.

## Code Explanation

### Scene Setup
- A scene is created with a black background to simulate the night sky.

### Camera Setup
- A perspective camera is used with a field of view of 75 degrees, adjusted to the window's aspect ratio.

### Renderer Setup
- WebGL renderer is used with antialiasing for smoother graphics, sized to fit the browser window.

### Star Field
- A `BufferGeometry` is used for efficiency, with 10,000 stars positioned randomly within a cube of 2000 units side length.
- Stars are rendered as points with white color.

### Animation
- The `animate` function uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations, rotating the star field slightly each frame to give a sense of motion.

### Event Handling
- **Resize Event**: Adjusts the camera and renderer when the window size changes.
- **Click Event**: Adds a fun interactive element where clicking the screen shows a temporary "You Found Me!" message at the click position.

## How to Enhance

- **Add More Objects**: Consider adding models like telescopes, observatory domes, or planets.
- **Improve Interaction**: Enhance user interaction by adding more educational content or interactive star charts.
- **Customize Stars**: Use different colors or sizes for stars to simulate different star types or add constellations.

## Dependencies

This project uses:
- **Three.js** (version 0.150.1) for 3D graphics. The library is loaded directly from a CDN in the script.
